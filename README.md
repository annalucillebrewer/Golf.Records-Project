<h1> Beginner Python Project - Golf Records</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of two simple Python programs that I created in an introductory computer programming course. The first program captures players' names and scores in a golf tournament through keyboard input and saves them to a structured format to a file name 'golf.txt'. that walks the user through "zeroing out" (wiping) any drives that are connected to the system. The second program reads the stored records from the 'golf.txt' file and displays the player names and scores to the user.
